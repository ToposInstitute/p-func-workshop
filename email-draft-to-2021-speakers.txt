Dear friends,

we are planning a second Workshop on Polynomial Functors for
the week March 14-18 2022, online. The next step in the
planning is to recruit speakers. Since we were very happy
with the speakers last time, we write to you all to ask if
you have suggestions for speakers. Maybe you have students
working on polynomial functors, maybe you have exciting news
to talk about yourself, or maybe you just know about
interesting recent developments. We were thinking of
repeating the format from last time, with 16 speakers, so we
cannot promise to accommodate all suggestions, but the more
suggestions we get, the better chances we have to put
together a varied and balanced program! If you have other
suggestions than speakers, we are also eager to hear them.

We are considering the possibility of involving the
Eilenberg-Mac Lane polynomial functor community, but we
think it is only a good idea if we have some indication of
connections between the two topics. We have not been able to
spot any ourselves, but maybe we didn't invest time enough
in it. If you know about any connections, or if you think it
would be a good idea to involve these people, please speak
up.

In any case we hope you will participate! (We apologize for
fixing the dates before contacting speakers and former
speakers, but the keep-it-open-as-long-as-possible policy
from last time was a bit time consuming for the organizers.)

Best regards,
David and Joachim.
