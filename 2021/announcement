WORKSHOP ON POLYNOMIAL FUNCTORS



At the Topos Institute and online via Zoom
2021 March 15–19 (UTC)


https://topos.site/p-func-2021-workshop/



Participants will learn background material and hear the latest progress on polynomial functors, monads, and comonads, their algebras and coalgebras, as well as on operads, parametric right adjoints, and cofunctors, with applications to combinatorics, database theory, dynamical systems, higher category theory, logic, and type theory.

Talks will be recorded for posterity.

(This may be the first in a series of such workshops.)
