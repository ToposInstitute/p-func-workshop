WORKSHOP ON POLYNOMIAL FUNCTORS

At the Topos Institute and online via Zoom
2021 March 15–19 (UTC)

   https://topos.site/p-func-2021-workshop/

Participants will learn background material and hear the latest
progress on polynomial functors, monads, and comonads, their
algebras and coalgebras, as well as on operads, parametric right
adjoints, and cofunctors, with applications to combinatorics,
database theory, dynamical systems, higher category theory,
logic, and type theory.
