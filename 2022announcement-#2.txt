2022 WORKSHOP ON POLYNOMIAL FUNCTORS


At the Topos Institute and online via Zoom
2022 March 14 – 18 (UTC)


*The workshop schedule, as well as titles and abstracts for (almost) all talks, are now on the website:*

https://topos.site/p-func-workshop/


Participants will learn background material and hear the latest progress on polynomial functors. The main topic is the notion of polynomial functors in locally cartesian closed categories, as employed in logic and type theory (the theme of the 2021 Workshop on Polynomial Functors). However we also include a tutorial and talks on the notion of polynomial functors in the sense of Eilenberg and Mac Lane, hoping to uncover connections between these two notions.

Talks will be recorded for posterity.
