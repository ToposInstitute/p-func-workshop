Dear Brandon, Christine, (David), Dima, Elden, Exequiel, Frederik, Marcelo, Nicola, Paul, Pierre-Louis, Sean, Steve, Todd, and Valeria:

Thanks for agreeing to speak at the 2022 Workshop on Polynomial
Functors! The workshop is scheduled to take place online March 14–18 at the following times:
  US West   07:00 – 11:00
  US East   10:00 – 14:00
  U.Kingdom 14:00 – 18:00
  Barcelona 15:00 – 19:00
  Tokyo     23:00 – 03:00 (+1)
Talks will be 50 minutes (main) + 5 mins (questions).

As you may be aware, there are two seemingly distinct notions of polynomial functors, which we might call
  Eilenberg-Mac Lane (Functor Homology) and
  Bundle "E-->B" (Locally Cartesian Closed category).
Last year we focused entirely on the Bundle notion. This year we will be including both varieties, with the hope of finding connections between the notions. To that end, we will be having a 3-session tutorial, run by Christine Vespa, to introduce the "bundle" community to the "Eilenberg-Mac Lane" ideas, as well as other talks on the subject. The majority of the talks, as well as Steve Awodey's 2-session tutorial on polynomials and dependent types, will presumably focus on the "bundle" version. We ask all speakers to please 
  *attempt to make your talk, or at least its introductions, elementary*
so that members of the other community have a chance to understand.

We have a bare website here:

  https://topos.site/p-func-workshop/

which we will fill up with content in the coming weeks. What we need from you now are three things:
  1. a photo for inclusion into our tiled image of the speakers,
  2. a tentative title for your talk, and
  3. a tentative abstract for your talk.
 
We look forward very much to this event, and we are proud you
have all agreed to to contribute to it!

Best regards,
David and Joachim
