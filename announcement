WORKSHOP ON POLYNOMIAL FUNCTORS


At the Topos Institute and online via Zoom
15–19 March (UTC), 2021

https://topos.site/p-func-2021-workshop/

Participants will learn background material and hear the latest
progress on polynomial functors, monads, and comonads, their
algebras and coalgebras, as well as on operads, parametric right
adjoints, and cofunctors, with applications to combinatorics,
database theory, dynamical systems, higher category theory,
logic, and type theory.

Talks will be recorded for posterity.

(This may be the first in a series of such workshops.)
