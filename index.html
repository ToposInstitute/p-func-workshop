	&#x25bc; <EM>Containers and inductive types</EM> </a>

	<BR>Abstract: Inductive types are playing a central role in Type
	Theory. They can be modelled using initial algebra of functors.
	However, not all functors have an initial algebra and the syntactic
	condition of strict positivity is reflected by the requirement that the
	functor is a container aka a polynomial functor. The term container
	derives from the intuition that an element of such a type 
	<EM>contains</EM>
	the data it is parametrised by.

	Recent generalisations of inductive types include inductive-inductive
	types (IITs), quotient inductive-inductive types (QIITs, related to
	generalised algebraic types) and higher inductive-inductive types
	(HIITs). In this setting we cannot identify one functor since the types
	of one constructor can refer to a previous one. An example where this
	shows up is the intrinsic syntax of dependently typed languages, where
	intrinsic means that we avoid untyped preterms. In our talk we describe
	recent and ongoing work how to capture these situations semantically
	and syntactically. We exploit the view that a generalised container is
	a presheaf that is a sum of representables where the base category is
	the category of algebras of the previous constructors. We present a new
	syntax for QIITs which is itself a QIIT and we conjecture to be
	complete for the semantics.

	<BR>Abstract: Dependent type theory is sometimes described categorically 
	as a Category with Families (CwF). 
In [1], it was shown that the notion of a CwF can conveniently be 
reformulated as a so-called "natural model", 
which is simply a representable natural transformation p : U. &rarr;
U over an 
arbitrary index category C of "contexts".  
Such a model of type theory admits dependent sums and a terminal type
just if it is a (pseudo-)monad, 
when regarded as a polynomial endofunctor P : &Ccirc;
 &rarr;
 &Ccirc;
  on
the category of presheaves on C.  
Moreover, dependent products correspond to a P-algebra structure.
The logical Propositions-as-Types conception is then modelled by a 
retraction of polynomial monads 
relating the type theoretic and the topos-theoretic interpretations 
of predicate logic.

	<BR>Abstract: Grothendieck in 'Pursuing Stacks' has developed a beautiful 
	axiomatic approach to homotopy theory. This theory was further deepened by 
	Cisinski. One of the main points of Grothendieck's approach is that a 
	'good' homotopy theory must come with a rich toolbox of instruments for 
	computing the main homotopy theoretical constructions. And he, indeed, provided
	such a toolbox using the category of small categories as a basis for his theory.
	<P>
	The category of polynomial monads contains the category of small categories 
	as a full subcategory of 'linear' monads. In my talk I am going to show 
	that the most important constructions of Grothendieck's theory can be 
	extended from small categories and their categories of presheaves to the 
	category of polynomial monads and their algebras. This includes: 
	Quillen Theorem A, Grothendieck construction, Thomason theorem, homotopy 
	left Kan extension construction, theory of homotopy final functors between 
	small categories, Cisinski localisations etc... It is interesting that some 
	of these constructions may have more than one analogue in the polynomial 
	monads world.
	<P>
	As illustration of how practical this extended homotopy theory can be 
	I will briefly sketch two applications:
	<P>
1. A theory of delooping of mapping spaces between algebras of
polynomial monads which leads to a new categorical proof of a seminal
theorem of Dwyer-Hess and Turchin on double delooping of space of long knots.
<P>
2. A theory of locally constant algebras of polynomial monads which 
generalises Cisinski theory of locally constant functors. The Baez-Dolan 
stabilisation hypothesis for higher categories and the classical Freudenthal 
stabilisation theorem are some of the direct consequences of this theory.
<P>

Abstract: Perhaps the most natural place to notice the duality 
	between functors and cofunctors is within the double category Poly(E) 
	of polynomials in a category E with pullbacks. Monads in
	Poly(E) whose underlying polynomial is a left adjoint are precisely
	internal categories, with the monad morphisms equivalent to internal 
	functors. Dually, comonads in Poly(E) whose underlying polynomial
	is a right adjoint are also internal categories, while the comonad 
	morphisms correspond to internal cofunctors. However, when E has 
	finite limits, Ahman and Uustalu characterise categories and 
	cofunctors in a different way, as comonads and comonad morphisms 
	in the full double subcategory of Poly(E) on the terminal object. 
<P>
In this talk, I will first discuss how the above view of categories
and cofunctors relates to the characterisation given by Ahman and
Uustalu. Next I will consider a kind of morphism between categories,
called a (delta) lens, which is both a functor and a cofunctor in a
compatible way. Finally, I will characterise split opfibrations as
lenses which behave nicely with respect to the decalage construction.

	&#x25bc; <EM>Stable species of structures</EM> </a>

	<BR>Abstract: We introduce a bicategorical model of differential
	classical linear logic that I will present both in intensional and
	extensional forms. The intensional model is based on a variation of the
	bicategory of groupoids and profunctors that results from endowing
	groupoids with structure of both logical and combinatorial character
	that stabilises the profunctors. Therein, we construct a
	star-autonomous bicategory and an exponential pseudocomonad on it that
	will be shown to simultaneously extend and refine the model of
	generalised species of structures restricted to groupoids.
	Extensionally, the structure carried by groupoids determines
	generalised domains as full subcategories of stabilised presheaves.
	From this viewpoint, we will see that the model consists of linear
	functors (finitary parametric left and right adjoints) and that the
	resulting cartesian closed coKleisli bicategory is that of functors
	that are stable and analytic (equivalently, epi-preserving finitary
	parametric right adjoints). This is joint work with Zeinab Galal and
	Hugo Paquet.

  Abstract: This series of talks will describe the theory of polynomials in a
category with pullbacks, as developed by inter alia Abbott, Altenkirch
and Ghani; Gambino and Hyland; Gambino and Kock; and Weber.

In particular, we describe how polynomials form themselves into a
bicategory, and explain the universal properties of this bicategory, as
described by Tamara von Glehn and by Charles Walker. If time permits, we
sketch the link to Hyland's "theories of algebraic theories".

	<BR>Abstract: This two-part talk is a tutorial on the use of coalgebraic techniques to
model and reason about state-based dynamical systems.
<P>
The first part will introduce the basic concept of an F-coalgebra for
an endofunctor F, and the derived notions of morphism, bisimulation,
behavioural equivalence and coinduction. We will see examples where F is
a polynomial functor as well as examples where F is a composition of a
polynomial functor and a monad in order to model systems with, e.g.,
nondeterministic or probabilistic transitions.
<P>
The second part will be an introduction to coalgebraic modal logic,
which is a framework for developing adequate and expressive modal logics
for specifying properties of system behaviours. We will see that many
results can be proved and studied parametric in the functor F.
Time permitting, I will discuss some recent work on generalisations of
the notion of coalgebraic bisimulation.

	<BR>Abstract: Polynomial monads on slices of the infinity-category of spaces can be described as cartesian monads whose underlying endofunctor is accessible and preserves weakly contractible limits. Such "polynomial" monads can be considered in more general settings, and I will explain how polynomial monads on presheaf infinity-categories are closely related (through an infinity-categorical version of Weber's Nerve Theorem) to monads describing homotopy-coherent algebraic structures defined in terms of "Segal conditions".

The lifting exploits the polynomial structure.

	<BR>Abstract: Quantitative Type Theory combines linear types (where we keep track of
how many times a variable is used) and dependent types (where we can
keep track of properties of terms using types). This gives a logical
system which is both expressive and precise with respect to the
resource usage of programs and proofs, with a rich model theory. I
will talk about data types in this setting, in the form of
"resource-aware" polynomial functors and their initial algebras, and
how "quantitative" induction can be derived from initiality.

	<BR>Abstract: Initial algebras of polynomial endofunctors are important 
	in computer science because they precisely characterize inductive datatypes
	&mdash;
	in the presence of extensional equality. If the equality is intensional,
	as is most often the case with modern formal tools, this correspondence 
	is known to break down since we can no longer prove the uniqueness of 
	recursively-defined functions.
    <P>
Homotopy type theory fixes this drawback &mdash;
and then some. Inductive types in homotopy type theory enjoy a correspondence
with algebras that are homotopy-initial: by definition, the space of
morphisms from a homotopy-initial algebra to any other algebra is 
contractible. Going further, we can show that the space of homotopy-initial
algebras for polynomial endofunctors is itself contractible, and hence
that any two homotopy-initial algebras automatically satisfy the same 
type-theoretic properties (equality a la Leibniz).

	Abstract: A set-theoretic polynomial functor is naturally a combinatorial object, which might be imagined as an abacus: a collection of columns, each equipped with a set of beads. Moving quickly but with little outside knowledge beyond the Yoneda lemma, I will use these abacuses to very concretely tell the story of <B>P</B>, the framed bicategory of polynomial comonads and bicomodules. In particular, I'll discuss both theory and applications of <B>P</B>.
	<P>
For theory I'll begin with an overview of some pleasing properties enjoyed by the category of polynomials. Then I'll explain Ahman-Uustalu's result that&mdash;up to isomorphism&mdash;polynomial
comonads are categories and Garner's result that the bicomodules 
between them are parametric right adjoints between the associated copresheaf 
categories. In particular every copresheaf topos is found as a hom-category in <B>P</B>. I'll also discuss the cofree comonad construction.
<P>
For applications, I'll recall the notion of Moore machines and show that
they are objects in a copresheaf topos C-Set for a particular category C;
I'll explain how the story generalizes to arbitrary C. I'll also explain
how databases and data migration functors live naturally in this setting. 
Time permitting I may also discuss how deep learning and cellular automata show up in <B>P</B>.
